Project Summary: Banking and Insurance Management System
Developed a versatile Banking and Insurance Management System using Java, with a robust architecture tailored to support financial and insurance operations. This project features a layered structure for seamless maintenance and scalability, highlighting proficiency in handling complex domain models and core business functionalities.

Modules:
Banking Services: Encapsulates core banking functionalities, providing a foundation for account management, transactions, and client services.
Insurance Services: Supports multiple insurance domains (Home, Life, Vehicle), ensuring comprehensive coverage for various insurance needs.
Employee Management: Defined a detailed hierarchy for employee roles, from EntryLevel to ChiefOfficer, to manage organizational structure effectively.
Exception Handling: Custom exceptions (e.g., InsufficientFundsException, BadCreditException) for robust error management and improved transaction reliability.
Utilities: General utility classes (e.g., DateUtil, LinkedList) aid in handling common data operations and enhancing code reuse.
Interfaces & Lambda: Leveraged Java interfaces and lambda functions for flexibility and to foster a functional programming approach where applicable, making code modular and easier to test.
This project demonstrates strong foundational skills in Java development, object-oriented design, and domain-driven design, making it an efficient and scalable solution for the banking and insurance industry.
